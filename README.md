result.json reports the ROUGE metric for our models.

Extractive Text Summarization(NLP).pdf is our report.

project.ipynb is our notebook, including our code and some explanations.

For the size of data and model checkpoints, we do not upload these files here. If you need these files, please feel free to email us and we will send you these files.

Training verboses in the notebook is not complete, because when we close the website of the platform, it will keep running but giving no more verbose. Our models are saved every epoches and the history is complete, so it doesn't affect our training.
